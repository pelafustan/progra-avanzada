# ProgramaciÃ³n Avanzada

This repository contains the source code for assignments and projects for the course Advanced Programming, a python-based OOP course, for Bioinformatics undergraduate students at University of Talca, fall semester 2020.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of this repository for running in your local machine for testing and what comes to mind with it.

### Prerequisites

I encourage you to use the latest available version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), but any `python --version >=3.6` should work. The current version is `3.8.2`.

The scripts was written on GNU/Linux, so I suggest you to run on a distro of your choice.

So far no other packages/modules are needed. If this last changes, I'll let you know.

EDIT FOR `project-1`: the project uses `pandas` library, so you need to install it. On ArchLinux, use `sudo pacman -S python-pandas`. For Debian-based distros, `sudo apt-get install python3-pandas`.

### Installing

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/pelafustan/progra-avanzada.git
```

Each folder contains a different assignment or project. To run it, only browse the folder and run the main script, e.g.
```
cd laboratorio_1
python Main.py
```
If you're using Ubuntu/Debian, maybe you should use `python3` instead `python`.

In the every subfolder, also you can find a README file with the details of the assignment or project (in spanish).
